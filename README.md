#  APIKuoshi

**One anime REST API — search, browse, metadata and playback through a single, coherent surface.**

APIKuoshi fetches anime data live from public web sources, normalizes it into one stable JSON schema and serves it through one endpoint set. There is exactly one way to do each thing: search, browse, episodes, streams, metadata — and every response feels like it came from one system, because it did.

**v2.1 — the /videojs/ stream refresh**: upstream changed how streams are served (raw embeds now 410). APIKuoshi rebuilds playback around the current `/videojs/` player — auto-migration, AES source decryption, 90-second CDN tokens — and renames servers to friendly codenames (`Vidstream-2 → riyo`) while keeping the raw label in `originalName`. See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

**v2.2 — the unified identity release**: every catalog/meta endpoint serves ONE canonical anime shape (single normalization layer, `src/core/shape.js`), the `slug` survives every transformation, ANY name resolves (`anilist:<id>` | `mal:<id>` | `<id>` | `<slug>` | `<title>` — colons included), AniList is an anchor instead of a requirement (MAL-only / slug-only identities degrade gracefully instead of 502-ing), `/api/meta/recommendations` merges AniList **and** MAL without dropping entries that lack an AniList id, and every episode carries a consistent `thumbnail`. See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

**v2.3 — the browse/catalog + art-enrichment release**: the WHOLE browse/catalog surface (home, spotlight, trending, rankings, top-ten, popular, random, upcoming, schedules, az-list, filter, genre, type, status, seasons, watch-order) now emits the exact same canonical shape as the detail endpoints — plus a single art-enrichment chain (`src/core/enrich.js`): upstream → **Kitsu** (keyless) → **TMDB** (optional, keyed), filling `poster`, `cover`, `backdrop`, `logo` and episode `thumbnails` with strict fallbacks. Every entry reports `artSource`. Provider failures degrade to "no data" — they never break a response and never fabricate art. See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

##  Highlights

- **One surface, one schema** — every list endpoint answers `{ success, api, kind, count, results[] }`; every anime is one canonical resource.
- **Canonical identity** — every anime has one key (`anilist:<id>` | `mal:<id>` | `<id>` | `<slug>` | `<title>`). Any endpoint accepts any format; the listing `slug` rides along on every anime-shaped response as the human-facing address.
- **Automatic dedup** — the same anime listed under romaji, English or synonym spellings is merged into a single result (title signatures + Dice/Jaccard similarity, with season/type guards).
- **Automatic failover** — data is fetched through internal lanes in priority order; a slow or empty lane never becomes your error.
- **Art enrichment chain (v2.3)** — when upstream art is thin, Kitsu (keyless) and optionally TMDB fill poster/cover/backdrop/logo and per-episode thumbnails; `artSource` says which provider won (`upstream | kitsu | tmdb`). Bounded concurrency (8), 24 h provider caching, per-request `&art=0` opt-out, global `ART_ENRICHMENT=0` kill switch.
- **One status/type vocabulary (v2.3)** — `RELEASING` and `Currently Airing` can never diverge between endpoints; art fields are explicit (`null` when nothing could fill them, never missing).
- **`/api/chain` — the flagship** — one call runs the whole streaming pipeline as nested functions: `resolve → info → episodes → servers → streams → probe`, with every stream URL verified against the real CDN and a ready-to-play `best` stream in the answer.
- **/videojs/ stream pipeline (v2.1)** — raw embeds are auto-migrated to the working `/videojs/` player, the AES-encrypted sources blob is decrypted, and a fresh 90 s CDN token is attached — streams play instead of 410-ing.
- **Friendly server codenames (v2.1)** — `Vidstream-2 → riyo`, `Vidstream-1 → kaito (beta)`, `HD-1 → hana`, … with the raw label preserved in `originalName`. One editable map in `src/sources/kaze/helper/cdn.helper.js`.
- **CORS playback proxies built in** — `/api/proxy/hls`, `/api/proxy/video`, `/api/proxy/subtitle` restream media through your own origin (re-tokenizing token-gated CDNs on every hop) so browsers just play it.
- **Zero required services** — no API keys, no paid subscriptions, no FlareSolverr needed. Optional upgrades exist (see Configuration).

##  Documentation

APIKuoshi documents itself, generated from the same catalog that powers the code:

| URL | What you get |
|---|---|
| `GET /api/docs` | Interactive API reference + playground (browsers) |
| `GET /api/docs.json` | Machine-readable endpoint catalog |
| `GET /api/openapi.json` | OpenAPI 3.1 spec generated from the same catalog |
| `GET /` | Landing JSON with quick links |

The v2.1 docs are a professional API-reference layout: a fixed sidebar with grouped endpoint navigation and search, compact reference cards with parameter tables, per-endpoint "▶ Try" buttons, and a docked playground (Send → status/latency chips → syntax-highlighted JSON, Copy JSON / Copy as cURL, request history).

}
```

### How streams are resolved (v2.1 /videojs/ pipeline)

Upstream episode links point at raw embed pages that answer **410** to direct playback. APIKuoshi auto-migrates every link to the working `/videojs/` player and walks the site's own pipeline:

```
megaplay.buzz/stream/s-{sv}/{realId}/{type}          ← raw AJAX link (410s)
  → megaplay.buzz/videojs/stream/…                    ← /videojs/ migration
  → player page → data-id                             ← file id
  → /videojs/stream/getSources?id=…                   ← tracks + intro/outro + enc
  → AES-256-CBC decrypt of enc                        ← { file: master.m3u8 }
  → + fresh 90 s HMAC ?token=                         ← token-gated CDNs
  → playable url · embedUrl · proxiedUrl · qualities · subtitles · skipIntro
```

### Server naming

| upstream label | codename (`name`) | note |
|---|---|---|
| `Vidstream-2` | `riyo` | |
| `Vidstream-1` | `kaito` | site's beta/pretest server → `beta: true` |
| `HD-1` / `HD-2` | `hana` / `sora` | |
| `VidCloud-1` / `VidCloud-2` | `akira` / `yuki` | |
| `VidPlay-1` / `VidPlay-2` | `miso` / `kenji` | |
| `StreamTape-1` / `StreamTape-2` | `arashi` / `taiki` | |

The raw label always rides along as `originalName`. To change any codename, edit `SERVER_CODENAMES` in `src/sources/kaze/helper/cdn.helper.js` — that's the single source of truth used by every endpoint.

**Play it in a browser:**

```html
<video src="http://localhost:6969/api/proxy/hls?url=<best.url>&ref=https%3A%2F%2Fmegaplay.buzz%2F" controls></video>
<!-- or take best.proxiedUrl directly — it already carries the right form -->
```

**Verdict meanings (`/api/chain`):**

| verdict | meaning |
|---|---|
| `playable` | at least one stream verified against the real CDN |
| `unverified` | streams resolved but probing skipped (`?probe=0`) |
| `embed-only` | only player pages found — play them in an `<iframe>`, not `<video>` |
| `no-playable-streams` | direct streams resolved but every probe failed |
| `no-streams` | no stream URLs could be resolved |

---

##  Art enrichment (v2.3)

Every anime-shaped response runs through one enrichment chain (`src/core/enrich.js`) after normalization:

| Order | Provider | Needs a key? | Provides |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1. **Upstream** | the scraped source | no | `poster` (wins whenever present) |
| 2. **Kitsu** | kitsu.app JSON:API | **no — keyless** | `poster`, `cover`, episode thumbnails (mirrors MAL's per-season split; `malId → /mappings` first, title search fallback) |
| 3. **TMDB** | themoviedb.org | **yes — `TMDB_API_KEY`** | `poster` (season-aware), `backdrop`, `logo`, episode stills (with `extractSeasonHint()` so "… Season 3"/"… II" map to the right season, and an air-date sanity check against wrong episode matches) |

Hard guarantees:

- **A provider failure never breaks a response.** Every call is caught and time-capped (12 s); a dead provider just means "no data" and the chain continues.
- **Nothing is fabricated.** If no source has art, `poster` is `null` *explicitly* (never missing, never a fake URL) and `artSource` is `null`.
- **`artSource`** on every entry tells you which provider supplied the winning poster: `upstream` \| `kitsu` \| `tmdb` \| `null`. Episode records carry `thumbSource` (`poster` = series-poster fallback).
- **Lists stay fast**: enrichment runs with bounded concurrency (`ENRICH_CONCURRENCY`, default 8), providers cache internally for 24 h, and in-flight requests for the same anime share one upstream fetch.
- **Opt out any time**: per request with `&art=0`, or globally with `ART_ENRICHMENT=0`.

TMDB is **optional**: with no `TMDB_API_KEY` set, TMDB is skipped silently (zero log noise, zero latency) and the Kitsu path still fills poster/cover. Kitsu works with no configuration at all.

---

##  Key formats

Every anime-shaped endpoint accepts the same `?key=`:

| Format | Example | Behaviour |
|---|---|---|
| `anilist:<id>` | `anilist:154587` | strongest, canonical |
| `mal:<id>` | `mal:52991` | mapped internally to AniList |
| `<number>` | `154587` | treated as an AniList id |
| plain title | `frieren` | resolved via search |

---

##  Configuration

Copy `.env.example` → `.env`. **Everything is optional** — the API boots with an empty config.

| Variable | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `PORT` | `6969` | HTTP port |
| `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | `*` | CORS origins, comma-separated |
| `RATE_LIMIT_MAX` | `240` | Requests per window per IP (0 disables) |
| `RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS` | `60000` | Rate-limit window |
| `CACHE_SECONDS` | `180` | Response cache TTL (0 disables) |
| `SOURCE_TIMEOUT_MS` | `20000` | Internal fetch timeout per phase |
| `DEDUP_THRESHOLD` | `78` | Title-match strictness 50–99 |
| `SOURCE_PRIORITY` | `kaze,ishi` | Advanced: internal lane order |
| `SCRAPER_API_KEY` | — | **Optional** paid scraperapi.com key |
| `FLARESOLVERR_URL` | — | **Optional** self-hosted FlareSolverr URL |
| `TMDB_API_KEY` | — | **Optional** TMDB v3 API key (free at [themoviedb.org](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api)) — enables backdrop/logo art, season-aware posters and episode stills. **The API works fully without it** — Kitsu (keyless) still fills poster/cover. |
| `ART_ENRICHMENT` | `1` | Set `0` to disable the art-enrichment chain globally (per-request alternative: `&art=0`) |
| `ENRICH_CONCURRENCY` | `8` | Bounded parallelism (1–16) for list enrichment |
| `MIRROR_DOMAINS` | auto | Optional extra catalogue mirrors |
| `STREAM_PROXY_DOMAINS` / `STREAM_PROXY_REFERER` | auto | Optional playback extraction tuning |
| `MEGAPLAY_SOURCE_ENC_KEY` / `MEGAPLAY_SOURCE_ENC_IV` | auto | Optional override if the site rotates the sources-blob keys |
| `MEGAPLAY_CDN_TOKEN_SECRET` / `MEGAPLAY_CDN_TOKEN_TTL` | auto | Optional override for the stream CDN token gate |

---

##  Testing

```bash
npm run check           # fast self-verification (syntax, wiring, invariants)
npm run test:live       # live end-to-end suite against the running API
npm run test:streams    # v2.1 stream suite: naming, watch (all servers × sub/dub), proxies, chain
```

The live suite covers every endpoint family, full chains (search → episodes → servers → watch), the `/api/chain` verdicts in all input forms, and clean-error contracts. The v2.1 stream suite additionally verifies server codenames, the `/videojs/` resolution, direct/embed/proxied playback (playlist → variant → MPEG-TS segment), subtitle proxying and chain probing.

---

##  Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause / fix |
|---|---|
| `502` on an endpoint | The upstream web data was temporarily unavailable — retry shortly; the failover layer already tried alternates for you |
| Stream `403`s when played directly | Token-gated CDNs need a fresh `?token=` + player referer — use the provided `url` (tokenized) or `proxiedUrl`, which re-tokenize automatically |
| Search feels slow the first time | First fetch is live + uncached; repeats are served from the TTL cache |
| Port already in use | Change `PORT` in `.env` |
| Behind a corporate proxy | Set outbound `HTTPS_PROXY` in your environment; the fetchers honor standard proxy variables where supported |
| Streams stopped working entirely | The upstream player may have rotated keys/URLs — check `MEGAPLAY_*` env overrides and the changelog |
